Forecasting in PyTorch with LSTM Neural Network
This repository provides an implementation of time series forecasting using PyTorch and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. LSTMs are powerful models for sequence prediction problems and are well-suited for time series forecasting tasks due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies.

Overview
In this project, we leverage PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, to build and train an LSTM model for forecasting. The model is trained using historical time series data and can predict future values based on past observations.

Key Features
LSTM Model: Utilizes PyTorch's nn.LSTM module to create an LSTM model.
Training and Validation: Demonstrates how to train the model using training data and validate its performance on validation data.
Forecasting: Shows how to make predictions for future time steps using the trained LSTM model.
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your_username/forecasting-pytorch-lstm.git
cd forecasting-pytorch-lstm
Install dependencies:

Ensure you have Python 3.x and PyTorch installed. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Replace requirements.txt with the actual name of your requirements file if different.

Run the notebook:

Open and run the Jupyter notebook forecasting_with_lstm.ipynb to see the LSTM model in action for time series forecasting.

Usage
Data Preparation
Prepare your data:

Format your time series data as a CSV file or any compatible format.
Ensure your dataset includes a clear separation between training and validation/test data.
Load and preprocess data:

Use pandas or any preferred data loading library to load your time series data.
Preprocess the data, including normalization if necessary, to prepare it for training.
Training the Model
Instantiate the LSTM model:

Define the architecture of your LSTM model using PyTorch's nn.LSTM module.
Set hyperparameters:

Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of epochs, batch size, etc., to optimize model performance.
Train the model:

Use the provided training loop to train the LSTM model on your prepared dataset.
Making Predictions
Evaluate the model:

Validate the trained model's performance using validation data to ensure it's generalizing well.
Forecast future values:

Utilize the trained LSTM model to predict future values for your time series data beyond the training period.
Example
